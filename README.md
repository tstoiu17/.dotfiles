## Tmux Shortcuts

Instead of using a prefix key, which I've found to be slow, I will try using 
terminal emulator (alacritty at the moment) macros, so that each tmux action is one chord

Alt + t = <prefix>t == new window (tab)
Alt + w = <prefix>w == close pane (closes window is only one pane in window)
Alt + s = <prefix>s == choose session from list of active sessions
Alt + v = <prefix>% == split pane vertically
Alt + [1-9] = <prefix>[1-9] == select window (tab) 1-9
Alt + Q = <prefix>Q == terminate session
Alt + d = <prefix>d == detach session
Alt + z = <prefix>z == toggle zoom current pane
Alt + T = <prefix>T == move current pane to its own window
Alt + [hjkl] = <prefix>[hjkl] == move between pane
Alt + , = <prefix>, == rename current window
