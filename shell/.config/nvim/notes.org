* how nvim works
** things that are builtin, but need a plugin for usability
*** treesitter
the nvim-treesitter plugin allows you to use the functionality already in neovim
**** install parsers for languages
**** provide commands to do things with treesitter
*** lsp
**** mason: install language servers
**** mason-lspconfig: bridge (mason <--> lspconfig)
* my config
** vanilla vim config
*** settings
setting tabstop and other vim.opt
*** keymaps
**** design decision: why does this only have mappings for default vim actions
keymaps for default vim should be separate from plugins and pluging keymaps should be configure together with the plugin spec so that removing a plugin completely (including keybinds) is simple (just delete the spec because everything related to the plugin will be contained in there)
**** just default vim keybinds
** plugins
*** lsp and language-aware stuff (treesitter)
idk if this is a good category because there are a lot of things that plugins do for lsp, they don't really fit neatly into a category
**** lspconfig
**** mason
**** treesitter
**** formatting
***** conform.nvim
**** commenting
***** comment.nvim
**** lsp ui good - should this be under ui
**** toggler (SPC I) toggles between pairs of strings "true" -> "false"
*** functionality (general purpose, not language aware)
**** telescope
**** harpoon
**** undotree
**** TODO a good diff plugin, or learn if the (-d) option is good enough
**** markdown-preview
**** vim-tmux-navigator
**** nvim-surround
*** ui
**** gitsigns
**** symbols-outline.nvim
**** incline.nvim
shows the filename in a top corner, so i can have a global status line but still know the filename of a split
